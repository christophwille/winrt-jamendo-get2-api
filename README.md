Station 366
======================

This WinRT App was started just before the [annoucement of a new API](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jamendo-dev/E61IaskwaW4) for Jamendo.
Instead of waiting for the new one or writing too much code for the (soon to be) old one, I decided to simply clean up the existing prototype into a working
online-only version. (online-only means there is no offline caching of stations / station images)
